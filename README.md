# TextFormatAndroid _(In Progress)_

A simple EditText for Android with built-in masking functions.

## Why?
There are lots of great libraries out there to help out with masking EditText Input with a 
specific pattern but none which feature pre-built functionality for some basic text formatting 
like phone number, credit card number and decimal number formatting.

## Features
 - Phone Number Format (eg. (123) 456 7890 or 123-456-7890)
 - Credit Card Format (eg. 1234 5678 1234 5678)
 - Number Format (eg. 1,22,345 or 122,345) and other likely such formats
 - Date Format (eg. 2016/16/07 or 16/07/2016)
 - Prefix Text (eg. PREFIX<REST>)
 - Suffix Text (eg. <REST>SUFFIX)
